                  I contacted Mr. Adler for a small business partner issue [that was] … emotional and heated for me
                  [and] had gone on for years. Upon meeting Mr. Adler … was very upfront and compassionate. He did not
                  pressure me during my initial consultation, which gave me time to contemplate all that would be
                  involved…. I considered my issue a very small fish in a big pond [but] … I felt like Mr. Adler treated
                  me and my case like I was one of his 'big' clients. He was extremely prompt in starting the case and
                  following up with any issues that arose. He always kept an open line of communication with me. As the
                  case progressed, he [gladly modified his approach] … for a positive outcome on my part. His advice and
                  guidance were spot on. He always had my best interest in mind and is an outstanding advocate. I am
                  truly grateful for all his help …. Mr. Adler is an extremely knowledgeable, professional,
                  compassionate and fair attorney. I highly recommend him!!!! <br />
